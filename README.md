## About The Challange

  

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot1]](./public/assets/images/11-express-homework-demo-01.png)

  

### The Task

  


```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

  

### Criteria

  


```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
  

### What was done

  

Created a No-SQL mongodb database with routes for API and schema for the DB. APP needs a front end and can be tested using a rest API software like Insomia or Postman as shown in the project video.
